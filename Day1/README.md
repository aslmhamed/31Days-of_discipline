First day of Revising Arrays.
Here is what I revised today.

1- What is Array in C?

An array in C is a fixed-size collection of similar data items stored in contiguous memory locations. 
It can be used to store the collection of primitive data types such as int, char, float, etc., 
and also derived and user-defined data types such as pointers, structures, etc.

2- C Array Declaration

In C, we have to declare the array like any other variable before using it

3- C Array Initialization

Initialization in C is the process to assign some initial value to the variable.

4- Array Initialization with Declaration without Size

If we initialize an array using an initializer list, 
we can skip declaring the size of the array as the compiler can automatically deduce the size of the array in these cases

5- Array Initialization after Declaration (Using Loops)

We initialize the array after the declaration by assigning the initial value to each element individually

6- C Array Traversal

Traversal is the process in which we visit every element of the data structure

7- Types of Array in C

There are two types of arrays based on the number of dimensions it has. They are as follows:

 1- One Dimensional Arrays (1D Array)
 2- Multidimensional Arrays

1-  One Dimensional Array in C

The One-dimensional arrays, also known as 1-D arrays in C are those arrays that have only one dimension.
