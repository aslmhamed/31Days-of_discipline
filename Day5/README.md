Day 5 of the Discipline game with cobby <3

Today i changed concept with my partner Segun Ogundele
So starting today I will be Revising C- Memory Management!

Here is what i revised today

Allocating Memory Dynamically

While programming, if you are aware of the size of an array, then it is easy and you can define it as an array
i can alloc memory using the following two functions:
1- var_name = malloc ( size * sizeof(type))
2- var_name = calloc (siza, sizeof(type))

Resizing and Releasing Memory

When the program comes out, Os automatically release all the allocated memory by the programs so if we don`t anymore memory we can release it by calling the function free().

Alternatively, we can increase or decrease the size of the allocated memory block by calling the function realloc(var_name, newsize * sizeof(type))
