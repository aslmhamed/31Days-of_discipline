The use of memory Management.

That's what i revised yesterday and today :)

DMA -> "Dynamic Memory Allocation!" Memory allocated at the run, i can modyfied at as i like.
according to my programming needs.
While is SMA> "Static memory allocation"

DMA uses the Heap!
While SMA uses the Stack!

In DMA > Memory can be reused as match as i like..
While SMA > Memory cannot be reused.

Why you ask!
Cause in DMA cause memory is used at the run time of program
and that`s one of DMA Advantages!
While in SMA memory cannot be reused cause it's used at the compile time.

DMA doesn't have fixed a size i can modyfie it as much as i like.
while SMA memory has a fixed size...

Also to use DMA; we can say that DMA is a pointer function cause
we have to use pointers in The DMA.

Those are the funcation used in DMA :
malloc(size * sizeof(type))
calloc(size, sizeof(type))
realloc(size * sizeof(type))
free(pointer name)
