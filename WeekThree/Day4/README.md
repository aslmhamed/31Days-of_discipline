Day four in the week three in the discipline game with cobby 

So in the fourth day me and my partner Segun we were tasked Develop a program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of structures and discusses how memory is organized for complex data types.

You can see the code in the C file above.

So now let's dicuss how the memory is alloacted for comlex data types...
        
            So, in this example the data type used is structures,
            and so, memory for a structure is organized sequentially,
            each member of the sturcture is allocated contiguous memory location.

            in the example me and my partner Segun used, the sturcture 'Student' 
            has two members; 'name' and 'roll_no',
            the memory for each sturcture is laid out in memory one after the other,
            and the next structure's memory starts after the pervious one.
