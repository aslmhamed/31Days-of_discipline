Week Three in the discipline game with cobby <3

Today we and my partner Segun, we worked on our fast task,
    making an array and populating it with user input, then,
    print it in reverse order...

I worked on the first part of the code, how can i get the input from the user
and intialzaing the array to the size of what the user wants.

While my partner Segun worked on the part where we will print the Array in Reverse order.
